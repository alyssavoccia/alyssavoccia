### Hi there, I'm Alyssa! ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently working on Lax Dashboard - a React app that allows teams to track and analyze physical metrics. Within the app, I am also learning and utilizing Material UI to setup layouts/components. I am also working on making it available to high school student-athletes to use to see where they match up against others across the country.
- Iâ€™m currently learning all things JavaScript and React! I would also like to continue working on my CSS skills.
